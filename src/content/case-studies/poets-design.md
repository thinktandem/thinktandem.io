## How do you find your favorite poem?

When Tandem began working with the Academy of American Poets to redesign and rebuild Poets.org, we were thinking of the millions of poetry lovers, teachers, and students who use Poets.org each year.

Poets.org is a HUGE website. We wanted to make browsing Poets.org feel like visiting a cosy well-run bookstore, not sifting through a hoarder's house. Simplifying this large and complicated site would help more readers find the poets, poems, educational resources, and events that could deepen their love of the written word.

## How We Did It.

We began with a series of discovery exercises to understand Poets.org's users and their needs, including...

-   Stakeholder Interviews

-   Industry Research

-   Analytics Review

-   Persona Development

With these resources the creative team worked with our strategists to review brand documentation and identify the strengths of the current website. We developed an array of creative assets including:

-   Wireframes for specialized content types

-   Mobile mockups

-   Desktop mockups

-   Invision Prototypes

The new design honors the tradition, creativity and overall brand of Poets.org, while simplifying the information hierarchy to help readers focus on the poetry without being lost in a sea of text.

To bring this design to life, we chose to migrate the legacy data to the new Drupal 8 CMS. However, instead of using Drupal's templating engine, we used a headless architecture. Drupal acted as an API to a NuxtJS app, allowing for dynamic page loads. This model will also allow flexible redesigns in the future, and the Drupal 8 API can be employed for other initiatives at the Academy for American Poets.

We also created a Drupal Blackbaud SKY API module to help synchronize member data between Blackbaud and Drupal, providing an easy way for members to view their status and renew membership.
